    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, yellow or white, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups (32 ounces) low sodium chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Saute the Onions and Garlic:</h4>
            <p>In a Dutch oven set over medium heat, add the butter. Once it <br> starts to foam, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until <br> both have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes.</p> 
        </li>
        <li><h4>Make the Roux:</h4>
            <p>Add flour. Stir to make a paste. Continue stirring until the flour <br> has taken on a light brown color. Stir and scrape with wooden <br> spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. The onion paste should look golden <br> with a little brown caramelization.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Add Tomatoes and Stock:</h4>
            <p>Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken stock, and <br> sugar. Stir to combine. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over <br> medium high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and let simmer <br> uncovered for about 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Puree and Serve:</h4>
            <p>Puree the soup with an immersion blender.Alternatively, fill a <br> countertop blender less than halfway with the hot soup. <br> Remove the center lid insert. This allows the hot steam to <br> escape. Cover the hole with a folded kitchen towel and place <br> your hand over the top. Blend. Repeat as necessary until all of <br> the soup has been pureed. </p>
        </li>

    </ol>
